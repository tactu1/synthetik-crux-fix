# synthetik-crux-fix
VB Script to fix line in save file preventing crux spawn and an optional batch file which will run script and launch game
NEVER EDIT THE VB SCRIPT!

Repeat after me

NEVER EDIT THE VB SCRIPT!
Edit the batch file so that the save file of your synthetik install is the input to the script.
If you're savvy (or just like doing things yourself) the script will run anywhere as long as you point it to the right location.
Watch out for Windows trying to make the script inert and saving it as a text file, the extention needs to stay .VBS otherwise it won't run.
